    <h1>
        Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which
        can contain data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties) and code in the form of
        procedures (often known as methods). The key principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
        Here's an overview of these concepts:
    </h1>

    <br>

    <b>Classes and Objects:</b> <br>

    Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a data type and the methods that can operate on
    that data.
    Object: An instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class, with actual values in place of
    parameters.
    <b>Encapsulation:</b> <br>

    Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit
    (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, and only allows the interaction through
    an object's methods.
    <b>Inheritance:</b> <br>

    Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class. The
    existing class is called the parent or base class, and the new class is called the child or derived class. This
    promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between the classes. <br>
    <b>Polymorphism:</b> <br>

    Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.
    There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
    Method Overloading: Same method name but different parameters or types within the same class.
    Method Overriding: Same method signature in both the parent and child class, allowing the child class to provide
    a specific implementation. <br>
    <b>Abstraction:</b> <br>

    Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties
    and behaviors they share. It hides the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. <br>
    <b>Association:</b> <br>

    Association represents a relationship between two or more objects where they are independent entities but are
    related in some way. It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.
    <b>Composition:</b> <br>

    Composition is a strong form of association where one class contains an object of another class. It represents a
    "whole-part" relationship. <br>
    <b>Aggregation:</b> <br>
    <h5>
        Aggregation is a weaker form of association where one class contains another class, but the contained class can
        exist independently. It represents a "has-a" relationship.
        These OOP concepts provide a way to structure and organize code in a modular and reusable manner, making it
        easier to understand, maintain, and scale software systems.
