    <h1>
        OOP CONCEPTS
    </h1>

    <br>

    <b>Classes and Objects:</b> <br>

    Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a data type and the methods that can operate on
    that data.
    Object: An instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class, with actual values in place of
    parameters. <br>
    <b>Encapsulation:</b> <br>

    Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit
    (class). It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, and only allows the interaction through
    an object's methods. <br>
    <b>Inheritance:</b> <br>

    Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class. The
    existing class is called the parent or base class, and the new class is called the child or derived class. This
    promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between the classes. <br>
    <b>Polymorphism:</b> <br>

    Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.
    There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
    Method Overloading: Same method name but different parameters or types within the same class.
    Method Overriding: Same method signature in both the parent and child class, allowing the child class to provide
    a specific implementation. <br>
    <b>Abstraction:</b> <br>

    Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties
    and behaviors they share. It hides the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. <br>
    <b>Association:</b> <br>

    Association represents a relationship between two or more objects where they are independent entities but are
    related in some way. It can be a one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many relationship.
    <b>Composition:</b> <br>

    Composition is a strong form of association where one class contains an object of another class. It represents a
    "whole-part" relationship. <br>
    <b>Aggregation:</b> <br>
    <h5>
        Aggregation is a weaker form of association where one class contains another class, but the contained class can
        exist independently. It represents a "has-a" relationship.
        These OOP concepts provide a way to structure and organize code in a modular and reusable manner, making it
        easier to understand, maintain, and scale software systems.

    <!-- use of interface -->

    <p id="interface">

    <h1>USE OF INTERFACE</h1> <br>
    In Java, an interface is a blueprint for classes that defines a set of methods that the implementing classes
    must provide. It consists of method signatures without any implementation. <br>

    <b>Implementing an Interface:</b> <br>
    Classes implement interfaces by providing concrete implementations for all the methods declared in the
    interface. This ensures that the implementing class adheres to the contract defined by the interface. <br>

    <b>Multiple Interface Inheritance:</b>
    Java supports multiple interface inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces. This provides a
    way to achieve a form of multiple inheritance in Java. <br>

    <b> Constants in Interfaces:</b> <br>
    Interfaces can contain constant fields (public, static, final), serving as constants that implementing classes
    can use. <br>

    <b>Default and Static Methods (Java 8 and later):</b> <br>
    Starting from Java 8, interfaces can have default and static methods with implementations. Default methods allow
    the addition of new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. <br>

    <b>Functional Interfaces and Lambdas (Java 8 and later):</b> <br>
    Functional interfaces, which have a single abstract method, can be used with lambda expressions for concise
    implementation. This supports the functional programming paradigm in Java. <br>

    In summary, interfaces in Java provide a way to enforce a contract on classes, support multiple inheritance, and
    allow the addition of new methods without breaking existing code. They are a key feature for achieving
    abstraction and modularity in Java programming.

    </p>


    <!-- instance of -->

    <p id="instanceof">
    <h1>The instanceof Operator in Java</h1> <br>

    In Java, the instanceof operator is employed for runtime type checking. It enables the determination of whether
    an object is an instance of a specific class or interface, allowing conditional logic based on the actual type
    of an object during program execution.
